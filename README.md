# UFSIT Constitution

This is UFSIT's official constitution. 

We put it here in case students believe a change to the constitution should be made.
If you feel this is the case, feel free to make a [PR](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request#:~:text=In%20their%20simplest%20form%2C%20pull,request%20via%20their%20Bitbucket%20account.) and the board will review it!

Note that, as a USSO (University Sponsored Student Organization), all changes must comply with the [constitution requirements](https://uflorida-my.sharepoint.com/personal/drausal_andrea_ufl_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fdrausal%5Fandrea%5Fufl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FConstitution%20Requirements%202024%2D25&ga=1).
